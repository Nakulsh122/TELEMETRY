We need to make a telemetry software that has the following features 

A.) Capture incoming data from the rocket.
    a.) the incoming data will be : {
        float altitude ,
        double Axis_X(roll),
        double Axis_Y(pitch),
        double Axis_Z(yaw),
        float speed ,
        float acc ,
        int_8 checksum
    }
    b.) Also make the flight computer.
        i) the flight computer will send the packets ,
        ii.) control all the operations of the rocket while in flight.

B.) Display the captured Data in realtime.
C.) Store the recieved data in a log file side by side.
D.) Be able to reopen log files that are saved.
E.) Replay the files content in realtime.
F.) Show the 3d oreintation of the rocket 

Language : Python 
Libs : pandas , matplotlib , any GUI lib 
Figma 

Also we need to make a datalogger for the test stand for the motors that we have .
